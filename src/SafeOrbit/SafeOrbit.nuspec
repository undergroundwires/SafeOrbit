      SafeOrbit is easy-to-use and strong security toolkit for .NET and .NET Core.

      While SafeOrbit's primarily focus is strong memory protection, SafeOrbit can protect any data in the memory for you: you have SafeBytes to protect binaries, SafeString to protect texts and even more to protect your application against injections. It also provides a bunch of tools to implement strong and high performance cryptographically secure algorithms for encryption, hashing and random.

    <releaseNotes>
      - Security -
        * IFastRandom is now seeded with strong random data.
        * Fixed memory leak problem in SafeStringToStringMarshaler.
        * Protection against timing attacks in SafeByte/SafeString comparisions.

      - Performance -
        * Optimized serialization and encryption with async operations.
        * Small optimizations in random generators.
        * Slightly safe string equality check with plain strings.
        * More parallel implementation in inner classes.

      - Other -
        * Fixed sanity check hash size function returning wrong value.
        * Fixed dead lock in async encryption algorithms.
        * Removed unnecessary code from StartEarly.
        * More small optimizations &amp; fixes

      - Compatibility -
        * Added support for netstandard2.0, net462, net47, net471, net472
        * Updated framework dependencies to the latest available for different platforms
